Let's go through the user flow for account creation and organisation setup by going through this file [@01-how-it-works.md](@file:qwik-gel/product/01-how-it-works.md)
Then let's go through current Gel(previously EdgeDB) schema using file [@default.gel](@file:qwik-gel/dbschema/default.gel) , make necessary changes needed.
Then let's implement a good sign up and sign in flow, sign up flow is already there in [@index.tsx](@file:qwik-gel/src/routes/index.tsx)
We are using Qwik here, so use Qwik syntax which has previously been used.
One the dashboard, show the organisation name if organization is linked, otherwise show "Personal account" there.
Focus on the core flow rather than UI. First plan it out, well and then only execute it.
Refer to documentation using search tool where needed.
