# I am using Gel(previously EdgeDB).

I want to create schema for it.

- I want to use gel auth system.
- I want to create a User table which should have name, email, and organization. One user can be linked to only a single organization. Along with organization, user can have a role which could be one of Owner, Admin or Member.
